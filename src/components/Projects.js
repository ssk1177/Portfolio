          This section showcases the projects I have built independently,
          reflecting my skills and passion for software development. Each
          project highlights different aspects of my expertise, from web
          applications to data analysis. I encourage you to explore the code and
          documentation available on my GitHub, where you can find detailed
          insights into my development process, technologies used, and the
          challenges I overcame. These projects not only demonstrate my
          technical abilities but also my commitment to continuous learning and
          improvement in the field.

            An end-to-end intelligent application that streamlines the job
            search and application process. It leverages BeautifulSoup to
            extract job openings from platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed,
            evaluates the compatibility of these listings with the user's resume
            using TF-IDF and BERT models, and automatically submits applications
            for positions that match the user's qualifications.

            An advertiser can post the job requirements, search for resumes,
